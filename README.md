# daily-drops

## Description

"It's dangerous to go alone. Take this!"

Every adventurer needs tools to protect them against the dangers of this world. Daily Drops allows you to visit the depths of a nameless dungeon once-a-day to claim a weapon of varying rarity. Some of them have elemental enchantments which make them useful when facing particular types of foes, and others still have special powers yet to-be understood.

The rarity of a weapon is governed by a percentage chance as follows:

Lesser: 20%,
Normal: 62.49%
Greater: 16%
Epic: 1%
Legendary: 0.5%
Godly: 0.01%

This project currently lives as a piece of interactive art in a good friend's apartment. Enjoy, and good luck!
